/* squashRow() */

Mutates tiles in input `row` according to following rules:

- Tiles are processed one by one
- Starting with tile at latest index, each tile tries to:
  - Move to furthest empty spot towards last index
  - Merge with next tile if it has the same value and hasn't been merged already in this round

Examples:

→ → → →
4 2 . 2
4 . 2 2  // moved
4 . .!4  // merged and flagged
. . 4!4  // moved
. . 4!4  // can't merge again

→ → → →
2 2 2 2
2 2 .!4  // merged and flagged
2 . 2!4  // moved
2 . 2!4  // can't merge different value
. 2 2!4  // moved
. .!4!4  // merged and flagged
