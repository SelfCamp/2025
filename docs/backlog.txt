Must have
- working board logic
- win on 2048

Nice to have
- tests (TDD workflow after basic functionality)
- undo
- time
- score
- when 2048, spawn 1
  - 2048 and 1 can now only be merged into each other
  - this must be done in N steps/seconds

OK to have
- difficulty levels
  - time limit per step â†’ random move if no move
  - limited undo (total no. / time to regenerate)
- user accounts
- scoreboard
- badges
- game replay
- multiplayer (opponent makes your every 2nd move)
- spinoff: contribute +1 version to http://2048game.com/variations/
